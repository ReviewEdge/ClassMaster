How to run ClassMaster:

(Building from the GitHub repo):
   (0) Found at: https://github.com/ReviewEdge/ClassMaster
    1) Clone the repository
    2) Use gradle to build a jar
    3) Move to the project head folder: ClassMaster
        (This is so that the database file is in the right respective location)
    4) Continue below

To run ClassMaster, navigate to this folder's location in a command prompt and run:
java -jar ClassMaster-1.0

All the commands available are found by using the "help" command.
Help will only show commands for the current "page" and will match all actions
you can currently take. This means that on a new "page" (The words before the : will change)
there will be a set of commands from help.

Thanks!

P.S. If building from the repo, make sure the db.db file is respectively at src/main/resources
